### Howdy, I’m Akshat 👋  
I build things that **work smarter, not harder**—whether it's AI, cybersecurity, or cloud-native systems. Pragmatic computer scientist by trade, caffeine-powered problem solver by habit.  

💡 **What I do:**  
- Engineer **adaptive systems** that solve today’s challenges *and* outthink tomorrow’s 🔮  
- Optimize AI workflows, fortify cybersecurity defenses, and scale cloud infrastructure 🔐  
- Occasionally break things just to put them back together *better* (it's science, I promise)  

🚀 **Past Lives:**  
- Built a **two-tier antivirus system** with **96.8% accuracy**—because security should be *proactive*, not just reactive 
- Designed a **blockchain-powered fundraising platform** that won **TAMUhack X 2024** 🏆  
- Interned at **Oracle**, fixing bugs, optimizing APIs, and making BI services less of a headache  
- Created a **Virtual Teaching Assistant** approved by **Boston University**—yes, the robots *are* taking over 🤖  

🛠️ **Tech I vibe with:**  
Python, C++, Java, Swift, TensorFlow, PyTorch, React, Docker, GCP, AWS, and *whatever makes my life easier*.  

💬 Always down to chat about **AI, cybersecurity, high-performance systems, or just random tech rants.**
